# Build a realtime analytics pipeline for you IoT application using InfluxDB and MQTT
Real-time analytics is a crucial aspect of any IoT-based application, providing you with the ability to make quick decisions based on the data generated by your device. In this blog post, I will provide a high-level understanding of how you can build a real-time analytics pipeline for your IoT-based application using MQTT and InfluxDB, instead of delving into the implementation details.

## What is MQTT
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is a lightweight protocol for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication that implements a publish-subscribe communication pattern. It is designed to efficiently transmit small packets of data between low-powered devices over unreliable networks. MQTT uses a pub/sub messaging protocol, in which each device is connected to an MQTT broker that acts as a central hub between these devices. Devices that are connected to the broker publish messages, and other client devices can subscribe to topics and receive those messages. MQTT is widely used in IoT applications due to its efficiency, low bandwidth usage, and small code footprint.

## What is Influx DB?

InfluxDB is a time-series database that is optimized for handling large volumes of time-stamped data. It is often used to store data generated by IoT devices, which can generate massive amounts of data in real-time. InfluxDB is designed to handle this type of data more efficiently than traditional databases.

InfluxDB provides two query languages: InfluxQL, a SQL-like query language, and Flux, a query data pipeline language. Flux provides more advanced data processing capabilities than InfluxQL.

InfluxDB organizes data into time-series, which consist of one or more points. Each point represents a single data record that includes four components:

- **Measurement**: A measurement is the name of a time-series and represents a specific type of data being collected.
- **Timestamp**: A timestamp is the UTC date and time associated with a particular point in the time-series.
- **Tag set**: A tag set is a set of key-value pairs that provide metadata for a point. Tag sets are optional but can be indexed for faster query responses.
- **Field set**: A field set is a set of key-value pairs that capture the actual data for a point. Fields represent the values being collected and can be numeric or string data types.

Here's an example of a point written in InfluxDB's line protocol format:

# Building the Realtime Analytics Pipeline:

To build the real-time analytics pipeline, we'll need to set up an MQTT broker and InfluxDB. We'll also need to configure our IoT device to publish data to the broker. Once the data is ingested into InfluxDB, we can use a custom dashboard to visualize and analyze the data.

## Setup the MQTT Broker:

To receive data from your iot devices, youâ€™ll need to setup an MQTT broker. One popular open source option is Mosquitto, which can be easily installed on your machine. After installing Mosquitto, you can use the Mosquitto pub/sub commands to subscribe and publish messages to the broker.

## Collect, Process and store data:

To collect data from your IoT devices, you can use sensors and devices to gather information such as temperature, humidity, and other relevant metrics. Once you have collected the data, you can use an MQTT client to publish the data to the MQTT broker. On the server side, you can subscribe to the message published on the MQTT broker and retrieve the data for processing. You can then process and transform the data according to your requirements, and use the InfluxDB line protocol to store the processed data into the InfluxDB database. The line protocol is a text-based format for writing data to InfluxDB, and it consists of four components: measurement, tag set, field sets and timestamp. Storing the data in InfluxDB enables you to store and query large amounts of time-stamped data in real time, and organize the data into measurements/tables.

## Visualize Data

Once the data is stored in the InfluxDB, you can visualize it on a web dashboard. If you want to visualize real-time data, you can directly connect your dashboard with the MQTT broker by setting up MQTT client on dashboard,  and display the data as it is received. However, if you want to display historical data, you can communicate with your server to query the data from the InfluxDB database. You can use various visualization tools to create the dashboard such as Grafana, Kibana, or even create your own custom dashboard using Javascript libraries like Vue, React and Angular etc.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, building a realtime analytics pipeline for you IoT application is a powerful way to gain insights from the data generated by your devices, and influxDB and MQTT are powerful tools that can help you do just that. I hope this blog post has provided you with a high-level understanding of how to build a realtime analytics pipeline for your iot based application using MQTT and Influx.
