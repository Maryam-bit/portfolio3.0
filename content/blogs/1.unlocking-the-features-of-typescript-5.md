### [Back](/blogs)
# Unlocking the power of Typescript 5.0 :rocket:
TypeScript recently released version 5.0, which is currently in beta. In this blog post, we will explore the most significant new features and improvements included in this version.

## Getting started 
To get started using the beta version of typescript in your project, you can run the following command in your terminal

```shell
npm istall typescript@beta
```

In order to use this version of TypeScript in Visual Studio Code, press Ctrl + Shift + P
to open the command palette. From there, search for the command "Select TypeScript version" and select version 5.0 from the list of options.



Let’s explore what’s new in typescript 5.0 one by one



## Const type Parameters
Typescript 5.0 introduced a new feature which allows you to speicify that a type parameter is a **`constant`** value. This can be incredibly useful when working with immutable data.

Consider the following example:

```ts
type Item = { name: string, price: number };

const createStore = <T extends Item>(items: T[]) => {
    const addToCart = (item: T) => {
        console.log(`Added ${item.name} to cart at $${item.price}`);
    }

    return { addToCart };
}

const store = createStore([{ name: "Apple", price: 0.99 }, { name: "Banana", price: 0.79 }]);

store.addToCart({ name: "Apple", price: 0.99 }); // works

store.addToCart({ name: "Apple", price: 1.99 }); // works even though the Apple with price 1.99 is not available in our store
```

In this example, TypeScript infers the type of the store variable as:

```ts
const store: {
    addToCart: (item: {
        name: string;
        price: number;
    }) => void;
}
```

This means that we can assign any value to the name and price properties, which is not what we want. One way to work around this is by using the as const keyword, which allows you to make objects immutable:


```ts
type Item = { name: string, price: number };

const createStore = <T extends  Item>(items: T[]) => {
    const addToCart = (item: T) => {
        console.log(`Added ${item.name} to cart at $${item.price}`);
    }

    return { addToCart };
}

const store = createStore([{ name: "Apple", price: 0.99 } as const, { name: "Banana", price: 0.79 } as const]);

store.addToCart({ name: "Apple", price: 0.99 }); // works
store.addToCart({ name: "Apple", price: 1.99 }); // Type '1.99' is not assignable to type '0.99 | 0.79'.ts(2322)
```

Now the TypeScript has inferred the type of the store variable as:

```ts
const store: {
    addToCart: (item: {
        readonly name: "Apple";
        readonly price: 0.99;
    } | {
        readonly name: "Banana";
        readonly price: 0.79;
    }) => void;
}
```

But, this approach can be cumbersome and easy to forget. With TypeScript 5.0, you can now add a **`const`** modifier to a type parameter declaration to cause const-like inference to be the default:

```ts
type Item = { name: string, price: number };

const createStore = <const T extends  Item>(items: T[]) => {
    const addToCart = (item: T) => {
        console.log(`Added ${item.name} to cart at $${item.price}`);
    }

    return { addToCart };
}

const store = createStore([{ name: "Apple", price: 0.99 }, { name: "Banana", price: 0.79 }]);

store.addToCart({ name: "Apple", price: 0.99 }); // works
store.addToCart({ name: "Apple", price: 1.99 }); // Type '1.99' is not assignable to type '0.99 | 0.79'.ts(2322)
```

This feature of TypeScript 5.0 is most useful for ensuring that objects remain immutable and can help prevent bugs

## All the enums are now Union enums
Enums have been made more strict which ensures that passing an unexpected value to a function that expects an enum will result in a compile-time error, rather than potentially causing a runtime error. This change is aimed at making enum more type safe and consistent. 

To understand this, let's take a look at an example in TypeScript 4.9:

```ts
enum Score {
    PlayerA = 30,
    PlayerB = 22,
}
function CalculateScore(score: Score) {
   console.log(score)
}

CalculateScore(Score.PlayerA) // works 
CalculateScore(30)  // works
CalculateScore(454)  // works
```

In the above example, we can see that passing an unexpected value like 454 to the **`calculateScore`** function still works.

Now, let's see the same example in TypeScript 5.0:

```ts
// Score is like a union of 30 | 22
enum Score {
    PlayerA = 30,
    PlayerB = 22,
}
function CalculateScore(score: Score) {
   console.log(score)
}

CalculateScore(Score.PlayerA) // works 
CalculateScore(30)  // works
CalculateScore(454)  // error
// Argument of type '454' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Score'.ts(2345)
```

In TypeScript 5.0, passing an unexpected value like 454 to the calculateScore
 function results in a compile-time error. This makes the enums more consistent and type-safe.


## Support for export type *

In TypeScript 5.0, support for type-only exports has been added. This feature can be useful when you want to keep your code organized and avoid cluttering your main file with many types that are not used frequently. Here's an example to illustrate how type-only exports work:

Let's say you have a file called **`shapes.ts`** that has different types of shapes and other code related to shapes:

```ts
shapes.ts
export type Circle = {
    radius: number;
    center: { x: number; y: number; }
};

export type Rectangle = {
    width: number;
    height: number;
    corner: { x: number; y: number; }
};
.
.
// remaining code
```

In order to use these types in another file, you can create a separate file called **`types.ts`**
 that exports all the types you need,  **`export type *`** will extract all the types from `**shapes.ts**` file

 ```ts
 In order to use these types in another file, you can create a separate file called **`types.ts`**
 that exports all the types you need,  **`export type *`** will extract all the types from `**shapes.ts**` file
 ```

 Now, in your main.ts file, you can simply import the types you need and use them to create your shapes:

 ```ts
// main.ts
import { Circle, Rectangle } from "./types"

const myCircle: Circle = {
   radius: 5,
   center: { x: 0, y: 0 }
};

const myRectangle: Rectangle = {
   width: 10,
   height: 20,
   corner: { x: 0, y: 0 }
};
```

This way, your main file become clean and easy to read, and all the types are kept in a separate file for better organization


## Package Size and Speed optimization
The package size of TypeScript has been greatly reduced in the latest version. The new size is 39.3MB, a 41.3% decrease from the previous version's 66.8MB. This reduction in package size not only improves the experience of installing TypeScript but also results in faster performance when running the program.



-------------------------------------------------

## Conclusion

In conclusion, TypeScript 5.0 brings some exciting new features and improvements that make it even more powerful and versatile. The introduction of const type parameters allows for better handling of immutable data, while the improvements in Enums make working with typescript even more seamless. Although it is currently in beta, it is definitely worth giving it a try. The part I like the most this release is the const type parameter feature, which makes working with immutable data much more intuitive and convenient. Overall, TypeScript 5.0 is a solid update that developers will definitely appreciate.

That concludes this blog post, see you in the next one.
